            "title": "An Exciting Idea For A Project",
            "content": "Since I got into machine learning I have been looking for a project that would help me to show off and further develop my new found skills. I have done some Kaggle competitions, which are great for learning about ML models and improving my coding skills, but I get this nagging feeling that I could do better than spend my time working on a problem that thousands of other skilful people are already working on. Whatever the problem in the Kaggle competition, it is going to be solved by the end of the competition. So, I may as well go and work on something that not many other people are working on. . I read this 3 part guide to how to come up with ideas for a machine learning project from Jose Quesada which was full of great advice: . Jose says your project should have the following characteristics: . Solving the problem must produce business value or help someone. . | It should pass the “eyebrow test” - the eyebrows of the other person should go up when you tell them about it. . | It should help showcase the potential benefits of AI. . | . Practical tips from Jose Quesada . You can learn more about people’s solvable problems by visiting sites like Twitter or Reddit and listening in to the conversation . | Pretrained neural networks are your friend - for example, this object detection algorithm is open source &amp; can be fine-tuned to your own task relatively easily. . | . Tips on data sources . You don’t necessarily need loads of data to solve a problem. . | Using multiple data sources might make something that was previously unsolvable, solvable. . | . Technical considerations . The problem should be one that it takes a human less than a second to solve. . | Do not obsess about the level of accuracy % - there might be enough value in 85% accuracy and a non-algorithmic way to solve any shortfall. . | . My problem . My children like Lego. One morning I was chatting to my son, asking him what he was doing. He had the “Lego Power Functions Idea Book” open and was annotating part numbers on to a page at the back: . . He got this book for Christmas and doesn’t have all of the parts needed to make the models in the book. So he was going through the parts list, finding them on an online shop and then writing in the part numbers so that he could buy the spare pieces he needed. This was both time-consuming and at times, a bit frustrating. It was frustrating because how do you find the part numbers if you don’t know what the part is called? For example, what would you search for for the grey piece at the bottom right of the image above? I have no idea. . I could see that there was a machine learning solution to this problem - training an image classifier which could tell you the part number of any piece you give it an image of. . After thinking it through a bit more, I also realised this was a potential problem for other Lego enthusiasts &amp; businesses too: . Second-hand lego sellers could create automated brick sorters - see bricklink.com which has 6m monthly visits. . | Lego users could use an augmented reality app to find a specific part among a load of lego parts. . | Lego fans could find the part number for any piece quickly and easily (from diagrams or real-world images) . | Lego users could use an image search to find bricks on marketplaces like bricklink.com . | . I had a look to see if there was anything in existence that already did this and couldn’t find anything. I found the following though: . An April 2019 April Fool’s joke where LEgo pretended there was a BrickFinder app . | A successful Kickstarter project from December 2020 which promised supporters a little box that could tell them which Lego part had been placed in the box . | A lego sorting machine, powered by AI, made out of Lego . | . The recent success of the Kickstarter project and the positive comments beneath the youtube videos convinced me that this would be an interesting project to try and that it passed the eyebrow raise test. . To go back and assess the idea according to the criteria set out by Jose Quesada: . Requirement Does this project have it? . Solving the problem must produce business value or help someone. | Would help my son, can see how a sorting machine would help second-hand sellers. | . Eyebrow test? | Needs more testing, but people love lego and I don’t think they realise image classifiers can help them with things like this. | . Showcase benefits of AI? | See above. | . What do they say on reddit or other social media? | Some say they are happy to sort bits themselves or they already know the part names. . I will share a basic version of the product with friends who are fans of Lego for testing &amp; feedback. . One one of the youtube videos a reseller was interested in talking to the designed of the lego sorting machine. Sorting must be a major time cost of theirs. . | . Can I use a pre-trained network? | Yes, easily. | . Can you get data? | Yes, both self generated with smart phone images &amp; some from brick reselling sites APIs. | . Can human solve in less than a second? | Yes, if they knew part numbers. AI is good with image recognition. | . I’m excited that this project could potentially showcase the possible uses of AI - I’ve recently become interested in the idea of using augmented reality to things. I fell it has many possible and exciting applications. This would be a good place to start with this and to practice my skills in creating a product that uses this technology. . What next? . Next up, I’ll create a simple prototype with one Lego set. This should get 100% accuracy when a user gives it an image. .",

            "title": "Starting With A Blank Slate",
            "content": "How do you go from a completely blank slate to having a plan? . Starting with a blank slate is exciting, but when you could make just about anything, the range of possibilities can be overwhelming. I came up with a three-step process for producing some coherent business ideas. . The three steps are: . Generate lots of ideas . | Organise the ideas and develop the best ones . | Criticise the best ideas . | Step 1: Generate ideas - focusing on quantity, not quality. . It is often hard to tell if an idea is any good at the time you have it. Ideas also sometimes arrive at unexpected times so I find it useful to always have a simple way to capture and record ideas. . To do this, I use the Braintoss app which I have set to automatically sends the ideas to a Trello board. . The Trello board acts as an “Ideas Park” a concept I took from the book How to be a Productivity Ninja. This works by being a place to collect and then organise the flow of ideas. . . What if the ideas aren’t flowing? . I find I have the best ideas when I am relaxed, doing things I like, reading a lot and that they often come after I do new things or visit new places. . My methods for producing ideas are: . Going for a walk . | Learning about the problems of others through: . Google search data . | Reddit or similar . | Conferences . | . | Thinking about products I like and how a similar approach could be applied to new or different domains (for example “Headspace for parenting” or “Brilliant for cooking”). . | . Step 2: Organise the ideas and develop the best ones further . An ideas park means that your ideas are stored indefinitely until you have the time or inclination to develop them (or discard them). . Leaving a bit of time also ensures that you don’t instantly fall in love with an idea and spend loads of time on it only to realise it wasn’t that good later. . Step 3: Criticise ideas . There are certain attributes I want any project I work on to have and also if it is to have any chance of commercial success. . I plan to develop a checklist that will provide a way of assessing ideas - this will provide a way of ranking ideas and should help to make sure that this is something that other people want to use. . Some of the types of things that will be on this list are: . Will it be fun to work on? . | Will it make people’s lives better? . | Can it be automated/does it require ongoing work to maintain? . | Can you easily explain the idea in one sentence? . | What do my imaginary board of mentors think of this idea? . | . Conclusion . I’m allowing myself plenty of time to come up with as many ideas as I can and I am trying to draw inspiration from a wide range of external sources so I haven’t completed this process yet. After I’m done, I’m hopeful a winner or winners should emerge. .",

            "title": "Launching Four Products In 12 Months",
            "content": "Launching four products in 12 months? . I read about Pieter Levels who set out to launch 12 startups in 12 months. I liked this idea and enjoyed reading about his approach, which advocated learning to make things yourself. . This challenge reminded me of an experiment I read about in the book Art and Fear. An art teacher split a group of art students into two groups. He then asked one group to produce work of high quality and the other group to create as many images as they could. The group who were told they would get credit for making more images created better work. There is a good summary of this experiment here. . I’m older than Pieter Levels was when he went for 12 in 12 months and I have a family who I like to spend time with, so I’m not going to be spending 60 hours a week on this. I still think I could make and launch at least four products in the next 12 months. . If that ends up being too easy, I will adjust the target. . About me . I’ve just moved house and find myself with a completely blank slate - I have no job, no commitments, some money to use if needed. So I thought I’d set myself a similar challenge - can I make things that other people would enjoy using and find useful enough to pay for? . I have the following skills that would help me in this challenge: . Coding ability . | Machine Learning understanding . | Learnings from a previous venture that didn’t really work out . | . Coding . I haven’t worked as a developer before, but have been learning to code in my spare time for a while now. . I read Jason Jung’s article about creating an app with Django in just five weeks, and it made me think this was something I could do. . I started by following a todo app tutorial which was pretty simple, but once you’ve made a simple site, it is just about learning how to add the things you want to add one step at a time. . I plan to follow the Django official tutorial while I’m coming up with ideas of what to make. . Machine Learning . I got into coding as I was interested in learning about machine learning. In the last couple of years, I’ve done online courses with deep.ai and fast.ai. . I have enough experience in machine learning to create models which makes me think I can apply it to any product I make where it might be useful. Or use it to create a standalone ML-powered product. . Learnings from a previous venture . The three big things I learned from this were: . Only make things that people are searching for - be driven by google search data. . | Friends will tell you something is a good idea just to be kind. Use data to make decisions about what to make. . | If you can code yourself, you can work at your own pace and aren’t dependent on anyone else. . | . Next steps . Ideas - come up with a large number of possible ideas. . | Research - read widely to help with idea creation. . | Technical learning - continue with learning how to make apps with Django. . |",
