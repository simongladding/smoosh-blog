            "content": "How do you go from a completely blank slate to having a plan? . Starting with a blank slate is exciting, but when you could make just about anything, the range of possibilities can be overwhelming. I came up with a three-step process for producing some coherent business ideas. . The three steps are: . Generate lots of ideas . | Organise the ideas and develop the best ones . | Criticise the best ideas . | Step 1: Generate ideas - focusing on quantity, not quality. . It is often hard to tell if an idea is any good at the time you have it. Ideas also sometimes arrive at unexpected times so I find it useful to always have a simple way to capture and record ideas. . To do this, I use the Braintoss app which I have set to automatically sends the ideas to a Trello board. . The Trello board acts as an “Ideas Park” a concept I took from the book How to be a Productivity Ninja. This works by being a place to collect and then organise the flow of ideas. . . What if the ideas aren’t flowing? . I find I have the best ideas when I am relaxed, doing things I like, reading a lot and that they often come after I do new things or visit new places. . My methods for producing ideas are: . Going for a walk . | Learning about the problems of others through: . Google search data . | Reddit or similar . | Conferences . | . | Thinking about products I like and how a similar approach could be applied to new or different domains (for example “Headspace for parenting” or “Brilliant for cooking”). . | . Step 2: Organise the ideas and develop the best ones further . An ideas park means that your ideas are stored indefinitely until you have the time or inclination to develop them (or discard them). . Leaving a bit of time also ensures that you don’t instantly fall in love with an idea and spend loads of time on it only to realise it wasn’t that good later. . Step 3: Criticise ideas . There are certain attributes I want any project I work on to have and also if it is to have any chance of commercial success. . I plan to develop a checklist that will provide a way of assessing ideas - this will provide a way of ranking ideas and should help to make sure that this is something that other people want to use. . Some of the types of things that will be on this list are: . Will it be fun to work on? . | Will it make people’s lives better? . | Can it be automated/does it require ongoing work to maintain? . | Can you easily explain the idea in one sentence? . | What do my imaginary board of mentors think of this idea? . | . Conclusion . I’m allowing myself plenty of time to come up with as many ideas as I can and I am trying to draw inspiration from a wide range of external sources so I haven’t completed this process yet. After I’m done, I’m hopeful a winner or winners should emerge. .",

            "title": "Launching Four Products In 12 Months",
            "content": "Launching four products in 12 months? . I read about Pieter Levels who set out to launch 12 startups in 12 months. I liked this idea and enjoyed reading about his approach, which advocated learning to make things yourself. . This challenge reminded me of an experiment I read about in the book Art and Fear. An art teacher split a group of art students into two groups. He then asked one group to produce work of high quality and the other group to create as many images as they could. The group who were told they would get credit for making more images created better work. There is a good summary of this experiment here. . I’m older than Pieter Levels was when he went for 12 in 12 months and I have a family who I like to spend time with, so I’m not going to be spending 60 hours a week on this. I still think I could make and launch at least four products in the next 12 months. . If that ends up being too easy, I will adjust the target. . About me . I’ve just moved house and find myself with a completely blank slate - I have no job, no commitments, some money to use if needed. So I thought I’d set myself a similar challenge - can I make things that other people would enjoy using and find useful enough to pay for? . I have the following skills that would help me in this challenge: . Coding ability . | Machine Learning understanding . | Learnings from a previous venture that didn’t really work out . | . Coding . I haven’t worked as a developer before, but have been learning to code in my spare time for a while now. . I read Jason Jung’s article about creating an app with Django in just five weeks, and it made me think this was something I could do. . I started by following a todo app tutorial which was pretty simple, but once you’ve made a simple site, it is just about learning how to add the things you want to add one step at a time. . I plan to follow the Django official tutorial while I’m coming up with ideas of what to make. . Machine Learning . I got into coding as I was interested in learning about machine learning. In the last couple of years, I’ve done online courses with deep.ai and fast.ai. . I have enough experience in machine learning to create models which makes me think I can apply it to any product I make where it might be useful. Or use it to create a standalone ML-powered product. . Learnings from a previous venture . The three big things I learned from this were: . Only make things that people are searching for - be driven by google search data. . | Friends will tell you something is a good idea just to be kind. Use data to make decisions about what to make. . | If you can code yourself, you can work at your own pace and aren’t dependent on anyone else. . | . Next steps . Ideas - come up with a large number of possible ideas. . | Research - read widely to help with idea creation. . | Technical learning - continue with learning how to make apps with Django. . |",
