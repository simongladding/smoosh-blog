            "content": "Launching four products in 12 months? . I read about Pieter Levels who set out to launch 12 startups in 12 months. I liked this idea and enjoyed reading about his approach, which advocated learning to make things yourself. . This challenge reminded me of an experiment I read about in the book Art and Fear. An art teacher split a group of art students into two groups. He then asked one group to produce work of high quality and the other group to create as many images as they could. The group who were told they would get credit for making more images created better work. There is a good summary of this experiment here. . I’m older than Pieter Levels was when he went for 12 in 12 months and I have a family who I like to spend time with, so I’m not going to be spending 60 hours a week on this. I still think I could make and launch at least four products in the next 12 months. . If that ends up being too easy, I will adjust the target. . About me . I’ve just moved house and find myself with a completely blank slate - I have no job, no commitments, some money to use if needed. So I thought I’d set myself a similar challenge - can I make things that other people would enjoy using and find useful enough to pay for? . I have the following skills that would help me in this challenge: . Coding ability . | Machine Learning understanding . | Learnings from a previous venture that didn’t really work out . | . Coding . I haven’t worked as a developer before, but have been learning to code in my spare time for a while now. . I read Jason Jung’s article about creating an app with Django in just five weeks, and it made me think this was something I could do. . I started by following a todo app tutorial which was pretty simple, but once you’ve made a simple site, it is just about learning how to add the things you want to add one step at a time. . I plan to follow the Django official tutorial while I’m coming up with ideas of what to make. . Machine Learning . I got into coding as I was interested in learning about machine learning. In the last couple of years, I’ve done online courses with deep.ai and fast.ai. . I have enough experience in machine learning to create models which makes me think I can apply it to any product I make where it might be useful. Or use it to create a standalone ML-powered product. . Learnings from a previous venture . The three big things I learned from this were: . Only make things that people are searching for - be driven by google search data. . | Friends will tell you something is a good idea just to be kind. Use data to make decisions about what to make. . | If you can code yourself, you can work at your own pace and aren’t dependent on anyone else. . | . Next steps . Ideas - come up with a large number of possible ideas. . | Research - read widely to help with idea creation. . | Technical learning - continue with learning how to make apps with Django. . |",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
